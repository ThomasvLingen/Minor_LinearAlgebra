* WAT TE DOEN
** DONE Warnings unsigned crap
   Thomas
** DONE Perspective
   Thomas
** DONE Matrix rotation
   Jorg
** DONE Matrix scaling
   Thomas (Gestolen van Jorg(Gestolen van Thomas))
** DONE Vector inproduct
** DONE Vector crossproduct
** DONE Test vector inproduct / crossproduct
** DONE Make sure that Matrixes are used efficiently (no double dot products)
** DONE Make ship controllable [translation]
   Thomas
** DONE Make ship controllable [barrel roll]
   Thomas
** DONE Make ship shoot an object
*** DONE Make ship use composition for LinalModel instead of inheritance
    This is needed in order to make Ship retain its members after a transformation
    Currently, when a Ship is transformed, all members are lost. Which is bad.
*** DONE Let ship handle arrows
** DONE Reimplement perspective with LinalMatrix
*** DONE LinalVector normalise
*** DONE Camera matrix
*** DONE Perspective projection matrix
*** DONE w calculations
